//  Class: SoRayPickAction
//
//  Picking action that intersects a ray with objects in the scene
//  graph. The ray can be specified by calling setPoint() with a point
//  in a viewport in a rendering window or by calling setRay() with a
//  world-space ray. In the setPoint() case, a valid camera must be
//  encountered in the graph to set up the mapping to world space.
//
//  The "pickAll" flag indicates whether all intersections along the
//  ray should be returned (sorted by distance from the starting point
//  of the ray), or just the closest one. In either case, the
//  intersections are returned as an SoPickedPointList. Each
//  intersection can be examined by accessing the appropriate
//  SoPickedPoint in the list. The SoPickedPoint class provides
//  methods to get the intersection point, normal, and other info.
//
